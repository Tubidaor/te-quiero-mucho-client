Hello,

This project is intended to be a journal, a mood tracker, and a relationship tracker.

Upon initial login, you will be prompted with a series of questions regarding your current state of mind. These questions will always be asked upon login are are meant to be static so as to be able to set a standard upon which to track your mood throughout time. The data from these questions will then be used to populate graphs in order for you to visually track your mood.

In the journaling functionality you have the ability to submit text, audio, video, and image entries. These additional features are meant to further supply you with methods in which you can keep track of your state of mind. Along with the data points, you will be able to dive deeper into how you are feeling, or things that have made you happy or sad, provided you are consistent with journaling. Ideally you will journal and everytime you use the app in order for the data points from the questions to match your journal entries. The point being is to have emperical evidence of your mood, along with reasons as to why you may feel a certain way.

In the relationship section, you will have the ability to link to your partner, and you will both be provided with the same series of questions. You will receive notices if you fall below a certain threshold, or if you deviate greately from your partners answers. The point is to capture any disatisfaction that may arise out of difference in perspectives, or discontentment from any particular issues that may arise from being in a relationship. This is meant as a tool for you to keep the relationship in a good state, and not letting issues fester or keep going without discussing. You also have graphical representation of the data points and topics so that you can track how the relationship is doing.

My hope is that this will help.
